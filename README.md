# Media-Player-Application
Using Android Studio

The music player application is an Android-based mobile application designed to provide users 
with a convenient and enjoyable way to play and manage their music library. The application 
allows users to play audio files stored on their devices, navigate through songs in a playlist, and 
control playback with features such as play, pause, seek forward/backward, and skip to the next or 
previous song. 
The application utilizes the Android MediaStore to fetch metadata about the songs, including title, 
path, and duration. It incorporates a RecyclerView to display the list of songs, with each item 
showing the song title and an icon. The application also implements runtime permissions to ensure 
proper access to the device's external storage. Additional features include the ability to customize 
the UI, support for serializing and passing song objects between activities, and the potential for 
future enhancements such as playlist management, search functionality, and integration with 
online music streaming services. Overall, the music player application provides users with a userfriendly and feature-rich platform for enjoying their music collection on their Android devices.
